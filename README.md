# GraphSL: Graph Source Localization Library

This is the source code of the GraphSL library to support the research of the graph source localization problem.

# Introduction

## Problem Definition

![image](https://github.com/xianggebenben/GraphSL/blob/main/SL_example.png)

Graph diffusion is a fundamental task in graph learning, which aims to predict future graph cascade patterns given source nodes. Conversely, its inverse problem, graph source localization, though rarely explored, is an extremely important topic: it focuses on detecting source nodes given their future graph cascade patterns. As illustrated in the above figure, graph diffusion seeks to predict the cascade pattern $\lbrace b,c,d,e \rbrace$ from a source node $b$, whereas graph source localization aims to identify source nodes $b$ from the cascade pattern $\lbrace b,c,d,e \rbrace$. 

Graph source localization spans a broad spectrum of promising research and real-world applications. For instance, online social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have been instrumental in disseminating rumors and misinformation with significant repercussions. Additionally, the rapid propagation of computer viruses across the Internet, infecting millions of computers, underscores the critical need for tracking their sources. Moreover, graph source localization plays a pivotal role in smart grids where isolated failures can trigger rolling blackouts leading to substantial financial losses. Hence, the graph source localization problem demands attention and extensive investigations from machine learning researchers.

The GraphSL library includes six state-of-the-art approaches and six benchmark datasets.


## Approaches

![image](https://github.com/xianggebenben/GraphSL/blob/main/overview.png)

 Existing graph source localization methods can be categorized into two groups: Prescribed methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNN)-based methods.

Prescribed methods rely on hand-crafted rules and heuristics. For instance, LPSI propagates infection in networks and labels local peaks as source nodes. NetSleuth employed the Minimum Description Length principle to identify the optimal set of source nodes and virus propagation ripple. OJC identified a set of nodes (Jordan cover) that cover all observed infected nodes with the minimum radius.

GNN-based methods learn rules from graph data in an end-to-end manner by capturing graph topology and neighboring information. For example, GCNSI utilized LPSI to enhance input and then applied Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for source identification; IVGD introduced a graph residual scenario to make existing graph diffusion models invertible, and it devises a new set of validity-aware layers to project inferred sources to feasible regions. SLVAE used forward diffusion estimation and deep generative models to approximate source distribution, leveraging prior knowledge for generalization under arbitrary diffusion patterns.

## Benchmark Datasets

|       Dataset      |  #Node |  #Edge |
|:------------------:|:------:|:------:|
|       Karate       |   34   |   78   |
|      Dolphins      |   62   |   159  |
|         Jazz       |   198  |  2,742 |
| Network   Science  |  1,589 |  2,742 |
|       Cora-ML      |  2,810 |  7,981 |
|    Power   Grid    |  4,941 |  6,594 |


Aside from methods, we also provide six benchmark datasets to facilitate the research of the graph source localization problem. All datasets are introduced as follows:

1. Karate: Karate depicts the social ties among members of a university karate club.

2. Dolphins: Dolphins represents a social network of bottlenose dolphins, with edges indicating frequent associations between dolphins.

3. Jazz: Jazz illustrates a collaboration network among Jazz musicians, where edges signify instances of playing together in a band.

4. Network Science: Network Science portrays a coauthorship network of scientists engaged in network theory and experimentation, with each edge representing co-authorship of a paper.

5. Cora-ML: Cora-ML is a portal network of computer science research papers obtained through machine learning techniques.

6. Power Grid: Power Grid delineates the topology network of the Western States Power Grid in the United States.

# Version Log
Version 0.11 removes the memetracker and the digg datasets, improves the IVGD method, and creates random seeds for reproducibility.

Version 0.12 adds the datasets downloader.

Version 0.13 adds the visualization of source predictions.

Version 0.14 uses the num_thres (i.e. number of thresholds to try) instead of specificing thres_list (i.e. threshold list) for LPSI, GCNSI, IVGD and SLVAE. Moreover, GCNSI, IVGD and SLVAE are improved to run on CUDA if applicable.
